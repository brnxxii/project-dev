        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hey! I’m Brian, a self-taught web developer who recently wrapped up a year of teaching college-level tech subjects. That experience helped me strengthen my basics — now I’m taking it further by building real stuff from scratch.</p>
        <p>Right now, I’m focused on learning modern web development, one project at a time. I enjoy turning ideas into clean, functional websites and experimenting with tools like jQuery, JavaScript, and anything else I can get my hands on. This portfolio is a work in progress, just like me — and that’s the point.</p>
        <p>This portfolio is more than just a showcase — it’s a reflection of my transition from the classroom to the code editor. I believe in learning by doing, and I’m not afraid to start small, stay consistent, and improve with every project. Whether it’s mastering frontend tools, exploring better UX, or automating small tasks, I’m here to grow — with curiosity, patience, and a problem-solving mindset.</p>
